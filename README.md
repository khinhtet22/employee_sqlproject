# 📊 Employee Analytics SQL Project  
*A complete SQL portfolio project analyzing HR data using advanced SQL techniques.*

This project explores and analyzes the **MySQL Employees Dataset** using **27+ advanced SQL queries**.  
It uncovers insights related to salary trends, promotions, employee retention, turnover, gender pay gap, department performance, and salary forecasting.

This project demonstrates strong **SQL data analysis**, **business understanding**, and **BI-ready data preparation** — key skills for Data Analyst roles.

## ✅ Project Objectives

- Analyze historical employee data using advanced SQL  
- Build reusable queries for HR analytics & BI dashboards  
- Apply analytical logic used in real companies (retention, salary trends, promotions)  
- Demonstrate mastery of SQL: window functions, CTEs, views, stored procedures

## ✅ Dataset Used

This project uses the official **MySQL Employees Dataset**, containing:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `employees` | Employee details |
| `salaries` | Salary history |
| `titles` | Job title history |
| `dept_emp` | Department assignment history |
| `departments` | Department list |

## ✅ Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL 8+**
- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (CTEs, Window Functions, Views, Stored Procedures)
- Power BI (optional visualization)
